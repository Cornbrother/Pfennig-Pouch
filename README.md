    ***
    NOTE: As the EXE was bundled using Pyinstaller, some Anti virus software will flag this as a virus. 
    This is purely heuristic/generic and because it is not a signed exe.
    If this bothers you, or you don't trust this application, you are instead encouraged to build it yourself or just run the .py script directly.
