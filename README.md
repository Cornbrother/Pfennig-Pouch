***
NOTE: As the EXE was bundled using Pyinstaller, some Anti virus software will flag this as a virus. 
This is purely heuristic/generic and because it is not a signed exe.
If this bothers you, or you don't trust this application, you are instead encouraged to review the code, build it yourself
or run the .py script directly.
